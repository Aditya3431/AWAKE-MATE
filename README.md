# Real-Time Drowsiness Detection System

This project provides a real-time drowsiness detection and alert system using facial landmarks and eye blink analysis. The system monitors students while studying to ensure they stay alert and awake, playing audio alerts if drowsiness or sleep is detected.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Captures video from the webcam and processes it in real time.
- **Facial Landmark Detection:** Utilizes dlib to detect facial landmarks and assess eye blink patterns.
- **Drowsiness Alerts:** Plays different audio alerts based on the detected state (active, drowsy, sleeping).
- **Status Display:** Visual feedback on the video feed indicating the student's current state.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy dlib imutils pygame
   ```

3. **Download the Pre-trained Model:**
   - Download the `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` file from [dlib's model repository](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2) and place it in the project directory.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script:**

   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

2. **Interaction:**
   - The script will open your webcam and start monitoring.
   - The status ("Active :)", "Drowsy !", or "SLEEPING !!!") will be displayed on the video feed based on the detected state.
   - Audio alerts will play if drowsiness or sleep is detected.

3. **Exit:**
   - Press the 'q' key to stop the program and close the webcam.
