# AWAKE-MATE
 This Python script uses OpenCV, dlib, and pygame to monitor students for drowsiness. It captures video from a webcam, detects faces and facial landmarks, and assesses eye blinks to gauge alertness. Based on the detected state—“Active,” “Drowsy,” or “Sleeping”—it plays appropriate audio alerts and updates the display.
